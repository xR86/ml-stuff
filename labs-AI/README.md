## Artificial Intelligence Labs

[Lab descriptions](http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~ipistol/ia1617/index.php)

### Lab 1
Implement a small chatbot with memory - saves the name, age and occupation of the people it talks to (after a first talk). The knowledge database must be written in AIML.

<!-- ### Lab 3

Implement the generalized problem of the towers of Hanoi (n towers, m pieces on the first tower). The instance is received as a command line parameter or from a file and the output is written to a file (a transition on every row, limited number of solutions).
Implement the following strategies: optimized random, backtracking, hillclimbing and A*.
The solution has to run the search algorithm 100 times for random instances (n and m - positive integers) and offer at output a statistic of: number of cases where a solution hasn't been found, medium number of steps for the solutions found, medium execution time for finding a solution. -->

### Lab 5
Implement a program capable of playing chess with pawns with a user. The rules of moving/capturing are the ones from classic chess.
  
### Lab 7
Tag words in a text (english) that are found in the DBPedia ontology with the word tag, where the value of the class atribute is the class (category) identified for that word is the one found on DBPedia. To correctly identify the words, some preprocessing is needing (tokenization and lemmatization) using the instruments available from Stanford or FII.
